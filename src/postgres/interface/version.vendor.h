/***********************************************************************************************************************************
PostgreSQL Types That Vary By Version

Portions Copyright (c) 1996-2021, PostgreSQL Global Development Group
Portions Copyright (c) 1994, Regents of the University of California

For each supported release of PostgreSQL check the types in this file to see if they have changed.  The easiest way to do this is to
copy and paste in place and check git to see if there are any diffs.  Tabs should be copied as is to make this process easy even
though the pgBackRest project does not use tabs elsewhere.

New versions should always be added to the top of each type's #if block, underneath `PG_VERSION > PG_VERSION_MAX` to cause as little
churn as possible.  This also ensures that new versions will not work until PG_VERSION_MAX and this file have been updated.

New data structures do not need to add #elif branches for old versions. See pg_time_t as an example.

Comments should be copied with the types they apply to, even if the comment has not changed.  This does get repetitive, but has no
runtime cost and makes the rules a bit easier to follow.

If a comment has syntax only changes, then the new version of the comment can be applied to older versions of the type.

If a comment has changed in a way that implies a difference in the way the type is used, then a new version of the comment and type
should be created.  See the CheckPoint type difference between 9.5 and 9.6 as an example.
