- Investigate libssh2 supported platforms
   - appears to be no explicit listing of supported platforms/architectures on the website
     build prerequisites are cmake and one of
     OpenSSL
     Libgcrypt
     WinCNG
     mbedTLS
     Search on the internet indicates that linux, the bsd's, macos, win32, vms, OS400, arm support libssh2.
     I joined and posted to the mailing list about supported platforms/architectures.
- Create skeleton for sftp driver (new driver files, adding sftp as a
  option in the build system, the option system, etc)
- Flesh out the storage driver functions using libssh2
- Parse fsync support from SSH_FXP_VERSION hello
- Throw error if sftp requested but fsync not available - provide mechanism to override this
- Add tests for sftp driver
