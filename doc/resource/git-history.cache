Before this change memory was allocated for tracking all three even if they were not used for a particular context. This made mem contexts unsuitable for String and Variant objects since they are plentiful and need to be as small as possible.\r\n\r\nThis change allows mem contexts to be configured to track any combination of child contexts, allocations, and a callback. In addition, the mem context can be configured to track a single child context and/or allocation, which saves memory and is a common use case.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit is that Variants can own objects (e.g. KeyValue) that they encapsulate. All of this makes memory accounting simpler because mem contexts have names while allocations do not. No more memory is used than before since Variants and Strings still had to store the memory context they were originally allocated in so they could be easily freed.\r\n\r\nUpdate the String and Variant objects to use this new functionality. The custom strFree() and varFree() functions are no longer required and can now be a wrapper around objFree().\r\n\r\nLastly, this will allow strMove() and varMove() to be implemented and used in cases where strDup() and varDup() are being used to move a String or Variant to a new context. Since this will be a bit noisy it is saved for a future commit."

These changes should be minutely audited but since the expect logs have little value now it is seldom worth the effort.\r\n- The OS version used to do expect testing (RHEL7) can only be used to test one version of PostgreSQL. This makes it hard to balance the PostgreSQL version testing between OS versions.\r\n- When a commit affects expect logs it is not clear (especially for new developers) how to regenerate them and our contributing guide is silent on the issue.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to migrate the integration tests to C and expect testing is not part of that plan.

Reducing the number of files is a benefit on all file systems, but especially so on object stores such as S3 that have a high file creation cost. Another benefit is that zero-length files are only stored as metadata in the manifest.\r\n\r\nFiles are batched up to bundle-size and then compressed/encrypted individually and stored sequentially in the bundle. The bundle id and offset of each file is stored in the manifest so files can be retrieved randomly without needing to read the entire bundle. Files are ordered by timestamp descending when being assigned to bundles to reduce the amount of random access that needs to be done. The idea is that bundles with older files can be read in their entirety on restore and only bundles with newer files will get fragmented.\r\n\r\nBundles are a custom format with metadata stored in the manifest. Tar was considered but it is too limited a format, the major issue being that the size of the file must be known in advance and that is very contrary to how pgBackRest works, especially once we introduce page-level incremental backups.\r\n\r\nBundles are stored numbered in the bundle directory. Some files may still end up in pg_data if they are added after the backup is complete. backup_label is an example.\r\n\r\nCurrently, only the backup command works in batches. The restore and verify commands use the offsets to pull individual files out of the bundle. It seems better to finalize how this is going to work before optimizing the other commands. Even as is, this is a major step forward, and all commands function with bundling.\r\n\r\nOne caveat: resume is currently not supported when bundle is enabled."

        "body": "Manifests with a very large number of files can use a considerable amount of memory. There are a lot of zeroes in the data so it can be stored more efficiently by using base-128 varint encoding for the integers and storing the strings in the same allocation.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that the data needs to be unpacked in order to be used, but in most cases this seems fast enough (about 10% slower than before) except for saving the manifest, which is 10% slower up to 10 million files and then gets about 5x slower by 100 million (two minutes on my M1 Mac). Profiling does not show this slowdown so I wonder if this is related to the change in memory layout. Curiously, the function that increased most was jsonFromStrInternal(), which was not modified. That gives more weight to the idea that there is some kind of memory issue going on here and one hopes that servers would be less affected. Either way, they largest use cases we have seen are for about 6 million files so if we can improve that case I believe we will be better off.\r\n\r\nFurther analysis showed that most of the time was taken up writing the size and timestamp fields, which makes almost no sense. The same amount of time was used if they were hard-coded to 0, which points to some odd memory issue on the M1 architecture.\r\n\r\nThis change has been planned for a while, but the particular impetus at this time is that small file support requires additional fields that would increase manifest memory usage by about 20%, even if the feature is not used.\r\n\r\nNote that the Pack code has been updated to use the new varint encoder, but the decoder remains separate because it needs to fetch one byte at a time."

The problem was that if archiving was not functioning then the backup had to complete before the user found out, which could be a while if the database was large enough.\r\n\r\nAdd an archive check immediately after backup start so failures are reported earlier.\r\n\r\nThe trick is to determine which WAL to check. If the repo is new there may not be any WAL in it and pg_start_backup() will not switch the WAL segment if it is empty. These are both likely scenarios when setting up and/or testing pgBackRest.\r\n\r\nIf the WAL segment is switched by pg_start_backup(), then check the archive for the segment that was detected prior to backup start. This should be common on normal running clusters with regular activity. Note that this might not be the segment immediately prior to the backup start segment if WAL volume is high.\r\n\r\nIf pg_start_backup() did not switch the WAL then we can force a switch on PostgreSQL >= 9.3 by creating a restore point. In that case the WAL to check will be the backup start WAL. This is most likely to happen on idle systems, during testing, or immediately after a repo switch.\r\n\r\nAn advantage of this approach other than earlier notification is that the backup directory will not be created so no resume will be attempted on the next backup.\r\n\r\nNote that some additional churn was created in backup.c because the load of archive.info needs to be done earlier."

That makes the additional memory ideal for object structs, but not so much for allocating a list that might change size.\n\nMem contexts can no longer be reused since they will probably be the wrong size so their memory is freed on memContextFree(). This still means fewer allocations and frees overall.\n\nInterfaces still need to be freed by mem context so the old objMove() and objFree() have been preserved as objMoveContext() and objFreeContext().

This also allows the option deprecations to be represented more compactly.\r\n\r\nIndex max is still capped at 256 because a large enough index could cause parseOptionIdxValue() to run out of memory since it allocates a static list based on the highest index found. If that function were improved with a map of found index values then index max could be set to UINT64_MAX.\r\n\r\nNote that deprecations no longer set an index max or define whether reset is valid. These were space-saving measures which are no longer required. This means that indexed deprecated options will also be valid up to 256 and always allow reset, but it doesn't seem worth additional code to limit this behavior.\r\n\r\ncfgParseOptionId() is no longer needed because calling cfgParseOption() with .ignoreMissingIndex = true duplicates the functionality of cfgParseOptionId().

Previously this was limited by buffer size without a custom implementation, as was done for read/writing files.\r\n\r\nSome cruft from the Perl days was removed, specifically allowing NULL messages and stack traces.

Because of the way options are indexed (e.g. repo1-4, pg1-8) optionList[] has 827 entries and we have kept it small by curtailing the maximum indexes very severely. Another issue is that getopt_long() scans the array sequentially so parsing gets slower as the index maximums increase.\r\n\r\nReplace getopt_long() with a custom implementation that behaves the same but allows options to be parsed with a function instead of using optionList[]. This commit leaves the list in place in order to focus on the getopt_long() replacement, but cfgParseOption() could be replaced with a more efficient implementation that removes the need for optionList[].\r\n\r\nThis implementation also fixes an issue where invalid options were misreported in the error message if they only had one dash, e.g. -config. This seems to have been some kind of problem in getopt_long(), but no investigation was done since the new implementation fixes it.\r\n\r\nTests were added at 0825428, 2b8d2da, 34dd663, and 384f247 to check that previously untested getopt_long() behavior doesn't change."

It is not just about identifying a major version, but making sure the build contains all the functions and catalogs we expect to make pgBackRest work correctly. It is better to reject early dev/beta/rc builds that may not work.\n\nSince 927d9adb was relatively recent the chance that this stricter checking will cause a problem seems minimal, so revert to checking CATALOG_VERSION_NO for every PostgreSQL version.\n\nLeave in place the code that pulls CATALOG_VERSION_NO from pg_control rather than the internal constant since the plan is still to allow catalog versions to \"float\" during the PostgreSQL beta/rc phase, which will be the subject of a future commit."

        "subject": "Add StringId type.",
        "body": "It is often useful to represent identifiers as strings when they cannot easily be represented as an enum/integer, e.g. because they are distributed among a number of unrelated modules or need to be passed to remote processes. Strings are also more helpful in debugging since they can be recognized without cross-referencing the source. However, strings are awkward to work with in C since they cannot be directly used in switch statements leading to less efficient if-else structures.\n\nA StringId encodes a short string into an integer so it can be used in switch statements but may also be readily converted back into a string for debugging purposes. StringIds may also be suitable for matching user input providing the strings are short enough.\n\nThis patch includes a sample of StringId usage by converting protocol commands to StringIds. There are many other possible use cases. To list a few:\n\n* All \"types\" in storage, filters. IO , etc. These types are primarily for identification and debugging so they fit well with this model.\n\n* MemContext names would work well as StringIds since these are entirely for debugging.\n\n* Option values could be represented as StringIds which would mean we could remove the functions that convert strings to enums, e.g. CipherType.\n\n* There are a number of places where enums need to be converted back to strings for logging/debugging purposes. An example is protocolParallelJobToConstZ. If ProtocolParallelJobState were defined as:\n\ntypedef enum\n{\n    protocolParallelJobStatePending = STRID5(\"pend\", ...),\n    protocolParallelJobStateRunning = STRID5(\"run\", ...),\n    protocolParallelJobStateDone = STRID5(\"done\", ...),\n} ProtocolParallelJobState;\n\nthen protocolParallelJobToConstZ() could be replaced with strIdToZ(). This also applies to many enums that we don't covert to strings for logging, such as CipherMode.\n\nAs an example of usage, convert all protocol commands from strings to StringIds."

        "body": "Up to four repositories may be configured. A potential benefit is the ability to have a local repository for fast restores and a remote repository for redundancy.\r\n\r\nSome commands, e.g. stanza-create/stanza-upgrade, will automatically work with all configured repositories while others, e.g. stanza-delete, will require a repository to be specified using the repo option. See the command reference for details on which commands require the repository to be specified.\r\n\r\nNote that the repo option is not required when only repo1 is configured in order to maintain backward compatibility. However, the repo option is required when a single repo is configured as, e.g. repo2. This is to prevent command breakage if a new repository is added later.\r\n\r\nThe archive-push command will always push WAL to the archive in all configured repositories but backups will need to be scheduled individually for each repository. In many cases this is desirable since backup types and retention will vary by repository. Likewise, restores must specify a repository. It is generally better to specify a repository for restores that has low latency/cost even if that means more recovery time. Only restore testing can determine which repository will be most efficient.\r\nFor single repository configurations there should be no change in behavior."

Parsing is now the only way to load a config so this removes some redundancy.\n\nSplit new internal config structures and functions into a new header file, config.intern.h. More functions will need to be moved over from config.h but that will need to be done in a future commit to reduce churn.\n\nAdd repoIdx to repoIsLocal() and storageRepo*(). Multi-repository support requires that repo locality and storage be accessible by index. This allows, for example, multiple repos to be iterated in a loop. This could be done in a separate commit but doesn't seem worth it since the code is related.\n\nRemove the type parameter from storageRepoGet(). This parameter existed solely to provide coverage for the case where the storage type was invalid. A better pattern is to check that the type is S3 once all other types have been ruled out."

Previously we waited until each part was acknowledged before starting on the processing (i.e. compression, etc.) of the next part.\r\n\r\nNow, the request for each part is sent while processing continues and the response is read just before sending the request for the next part. This asynchronous method allows us to continue processing while the S3 server formulates a response.\r\n\r\nTesting from outside AWS in a high-bandwidth, low-latency environment showed a 35% improvement in the upload time of 1GB files. The time spent waiting for multipart notifications was reduced by ~300% (this measurement included the final part which is not uploaded asynchronously).\r\n\r\nThere are still some possible improvements: 1) the creation of the multipart id could be made asynchronous when it looks like the upload will need to be multipart (this may incur cost if the upload turns out not to be multipart). 2) allow more than one async request (this will use more memory).\r\n\r\nA fair amount of refactoring was required to make the HTTP responses asynchronous. This may seem like overkill but having well-defined request, response, and session objects will also be advantageous for the upcoming HTTP server functionality.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage is that the lifecycle of an HttpSession is better defined. We only want to reuse sessions that complete the request/response cycle successfully, otherwise we consider the session to be in a bad state and would prefer to start clean with a new one. Previously, this required complex notifications to mark a session as \"successfully done\". Now, ownership of the session is passed to the request and then the response and only returned to the client after a successful response. If an error occurs anywhere along the way the session will be automatically closed by the object destructor when the request/response object is freed (depending on which one currently owns the session)."

        "body": "Test matrices were previously simplified for the mock/* tests (e.g. d4410611, d489eb87) but not for real/all since the rules for which tests would run with which options was extremely complex. This only got more complex when new compression formats were added.\n\nBecause the loop-generated matrix was so large, mosts tests were skipped for most option combinations following arcane logic which was nearly impossible to decipher even when reading the code, and completely impossible from the test.pl interface. As a consequence, important tests got excluded. For example, backup from standby was excluded for most versions of PostgreSQL because it was only run once per distro, against the latest version to be included in that distro.\n\nSimplify the tests by having a single run per PostgreSQL version and vary test parameters according to the capabilities of each version and the underlying distro. So, ZST testing is based on whether the distro supports ZST. Every test is run for each set of parameters based on the capabilities of the PostgreSQL version, e.g. backup from standby is not attempted on versions that don't support it.\n\nNote that since more tests are running the overall time to run the mock/all tests has increased by about 20-25%. Some time may be saved my removing tests that are adequately covered by unit tests but that should the subject of another commit. Another option would be to limit some non version-specific tests to a single, well defined version of PostgreSQL, .e.g the version that is run by expect tests, currently 9.6.\n\nThe motivation for this refactor is that new storage drivers are coming and the loop-generated test matrix simply was not up to the task of adding them.\n\nThe following is an example of the new test log (note longer runtime of each test):\n\nmodule=real, test=all, run=1, pg-version=10 (106.91s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=1, pg-version=9.5 (151.09s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=1, pg-version=9.2 (123.11s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=1, pg-version=9.1 (129s)\n\nvs. the old test log (sub-second tests were skipped entirely):\n\nmodule=real, test=all, run=2, pg-version=10 (0.31s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=3, pg-version=10 (0.26s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=4, pg-version=10 (60.39s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=1, pg-version=10 (69.12s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=6, pg-version=10 (34s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=5, pg-version=10 (42.75s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=2, pg-version=9.5 (0.21s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=3, pg-version=9.5 (0.21s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=4, pg-version=9.5 (0.21s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=5, pg-version=9.5 (0.26s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=6, pg-version=9.5 (0.21s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=1, pg-version=9.2 (72.78s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=2, pg-version=9.2 (0.26s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=3, pg-version=9.2 (0.31s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=4, pg-version=9.2 (0.21s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=5, pg-version=9.2 (0.21s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=6, pg-version=9.2 (0.21s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=1, pg-version=9.5 (88.41s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=2, pg-version=9.1 (0.21s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=3, pg-version=9.1 (0.26s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=4, pg-version=9.1 (0.21s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=5, pg-version=9.1 (0.31s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=6, pg-version=9.1 (0.26s)\nmodule=real, test=all, run=1, pg-version=9.1 (72.4s)"

        "body": "The prior default was determined by benchmarking the Perl code prior to the 1.0 release. In general buffer allocation was more expensive in Perl so large buffers gave the best performance. This was due to multiple buffer allocations for each filter in an IO operation.\n\nThe C code allocates fixed buffers for each IO operation so the cost for buffer allocation is lower than Perl. That being the case it made sense to benchmark the C code to determine the optimal buffer default.\n\nThe performance/storage tests were used to measure the performance of a variety of filters. 1GiB of data was processed by each filter 10 times and the results of the tests were averaged.\n\nWhile most buffer sizes gave similar performance, 1MiB appeared to perform the best overall. Of course, different architectures are likely to yield different results but this seems like a sensible default. The buffer-size option may still need to be manually configured to give optimal results.\n\nRaw test data for reference:\n\n4MB buffer (prior default)\n\ncopy time 1807ms, avg time 180ms, avg throughput: 5942MB/s\nmd5 time 14200ms, avg time 1420ms, avg throughput: 756MB/s\nsha1 time 11431ms, avg time 1143ms, avg throughput: 939MB/s\nsha256 time 23463ms, avg time 2346ms, avg throughput: 457MB/s\ngzip -6 time 381199ms, avg time 38119ms, avg throughput: 28MB/s\nlz4 -1 time 15484ms, avg time 1548ms, avg throughput: 693MB/s\n\n1MB buffer (new default)\n\ncopy time 1760ms, avg time 176ms, avg throughput: 6100MB/s\nmd5 time 13739ms, avg time 1373ms, avg throughput: 781MB/s\nsha1 time 11025ms, avg time 1102ms, avg throughput: 973MB/s\nsha256 time 22539ms, avg time 2253ms, avg throughput: 476MB/s\ngzip -6 time 372995ms, avg time 37299ms, avg throughput: 28MB/s\nlz4 -1 time 15118ms, avg time 1511ms, avg throughput: 710MB/s\n\n512K buffer\n\ncopy time 1782ms, avg time 178ms, avg throughput: 6025MB/s\nmd5 time 13724ms, avg time 1372ms, avg throughput: 782MB/s\nsha1 time 10959ms, avg time 1095ms, avg throughput: 979MB/s\nsha256 time 22982ms, avg time 2298ms, avg throughput: 467MB/s\ngzip -6 time 378120ms, avg time 37812ms, avg throughput: 28MB/s\nlz4 -1 time 15484ms, avg time 1548ms, avg throughput: 693MB/s\n\n256K buffer\n\ncopy time 1805ms, avg time 180ms, avg throughput: 5948MB/s\nmd5 time 13706ms, avg time 1370ms, avg throughput: 783MB/s\nsha1 time 11074ms, avg time 1107ms, avg throughput: 969MB/s\nsha256 time 22588ms, avg time 2258ms, avg throughput: 475MB/s\ngzip -6 time 372645ms, avg time 37264ms, avg throughput: 28MB/s\nlz4 -1 time 16346ms, avg time 1634ms, avg throughput: 656MB/s"

Using this method, a full backup can be expired only if the time the backup completed is older than the number of days set with repo-retention-full (calculated from the moment the 'expire' command is run) and at least one full backup meets the retention period. If archive retention has not been configured, then the default settings will expire archives that are prior to the oldest retained full backup. For example, if there are three full backups ending in times that are 25 days old (F1), 20 days old (F2) and 10 days old (F3), then if the full retention period is 15 days, then only F1 will be expired; F2 will be retained because F1 is not at least 15 days old."

However, this has caused problems for some users in the past (because they needed the WAL for other purposes) and with the new adhoc and time-based retention features, it was decided that the archives should remain until the threshold was met. The archives will eventually be removed and if having them causes space issues, the expire command and the retention-archive can always be run and adjusted."

Testing in production environments that were prone to locking shows that the approach is promising and at the very least not a regression.\n\nThe main differences from the blocking version are the non-blocking connect() implementation and handling of WANT_READ/WANT_WRITE retries for all SSL*() functions.\n\nTimeouts in the tests needed to be increased because socket connect() and TLS SSL_connect() were not included in the timeout before.

That way Posix can work efficiently and all drivers can return only the data required which saves some bandwidth. The storageList() and storageInfoList() functions remain in the storage interface since they are useful -- the only change is simplifying the drivers with no external impact.\n\nNote that since list() accepted an expression infoList() must now do so. Checking the expression is optional for the driver but can be used to limit results or save IO costs.\n\nSimilarly, exists() and pathExists() are just specialized forms of info() so adapt them to call info() instead."

Even though it was slightly faster, it omitted the crc-32 that is generated during normal compression which could lead to corrupt data after a bad network transmission.

Normally, the stack is not used for this purpose and pushing/popping is a cheap operation. In the prior implementation most of the TRY...CATCH logic needed to be run even on success.\n\nOne bonus is that the binary is about 8% smaller after this change.  Another benefit is that new contexts *must* be explicitly freed/discarded or an error will occur.  See info/manifest.c for an example of where this is useful outside the standard macros."

This is probably only possible if the async process exits immediately, perhaps due to a chdir() failure. Set SIGCHLD back to default in the async process so waitpid() will work as expected.\n\nAlso update the comment on chdir() to more accurately reflect what is happening.\n\nFinally, add a test in certain debug builds to ensure the first fork exits very quickly. This only works when valgrind is not in use because valgrind makes forking so slow that it is hard to tell if the async process performed work or not (in the case that the second fork goes missing and the async process is a direct child)."

        "body": "Previously memNew() used memset() to initialize all struct members to 0, NULL, false, etc.  While this appears to work in practice, it is a violation of the C specification.  For instance, NULL == 0 must be true but neither NULL nor 0 must be represented with all zero bits.\n\nInstead use designated initializers to initialize structs.  These guarantee that struct members will be properly initialized even if they are not specified in the initializer.  Note that due to a quirk in the C99 specification at least one member must be explicitly initialized even if it needs to be the default value.\n\nSince pre-zeroed memory is no longer required, adjust memAllocInternal()/memReallocInternal() to return raw memory and update dependent functions accordingly.  All instances of memset() have been removed except in debug/test code where needed.\n\nAdd memNewPtrArray() to allocate an array of pointers and automatically set all pointers to NULL.\n\nRename memGrowRaw() to the more logical memResize()."

This has never been an issue in the field that we know of, but we found it in testing.\n\nFor online backups all times are fetched from the PostgreSQL primary host (before only copy start was).  This doesn't affect backup integrity but it does prevent clock skew between hosts affecting backup duration reporting.\n\nArchive copy now works as expected when the archive and backup have different compression settings, i.e. when one is compressed and the other is not.

Tests in containers will continue to update /etc/hosts and use the custom host.\n\nAdd infrastructure and update harnessCfgLoad*() to get the correct exe and paths loaded for testing.\n\nSince new tests are required to verify that running outside a container works, also rework the tests in Travis CI to provide coverage within a reasonable amount of time.

        "body": "For the most part this is a direct migration of the Perl code into C.\n\nThere is one important behavioral change with regard to how file permissions are handled.  The Perl code tried to set ownership as it was in the manifest even when running as an unprivileged user.  This usually just led to errors and frustration.\n\nThe C code works like this:\n\nIf a restore is run as a non-root user (the typical scenario) then all files restored will belong to the user/group executing pgBackRest. If existing files are not owned by the executing user/group then an error will result if the ownership cannot be updated to the executing user/group. In that case the file ownership will need to be updated by a privileged user before the restore can be retried.\n\nIf a restore is run as the root user then pgBackRest will attempt to recreate the ownership recorded in the manifest when the backup was made. Only user/group names are stored in the manifest so the same names must exist on the restore host for this to work. If the user/group name cannot be found locally then the user/group of the PostgreSQL data directory will be used and finally root if the data directory user/group cannot be mapped to a name."

Use a similar method for save to avoid having an intermediate copy. Save is a bit complex because sections/keys must be written in alpha order or older versions of pgBackRest will not calculate the correct checksum.\n\nAlso move the load retry logic to helper functions rather than embedding it in the Info object.

This will continue to be true until the Perl storage interface is retired at the end of the C migration.\n\nNote that for reasonable numbers of tables there is no detectable difference.  The case in question involved 250K tables with a 10 minute decode time (which was being doubled) on a fast workstation."

This made it impossible to tell which branches belonged to which, and in any case an overzealous exclusion rule was ignoring all branches in such cases.  Add the DEBUG_COVERAGE flag to build a modified version of the macros without any internal branches to be used for coverage testing.  In most cases, the branches were optimizations (like checking logWill()) that improve production performance but are not needed for testing.  In other cases, a parameter needed to be added to the underlying function to handle the branch during coverage testing.\n\nAlso tweak the coverage rules so that macros without conditionals are automatically excluded from branch coverage as long as they are not themselves a parameter.\n\nFinally, update tests and code where missing coverage was exposed by these changes.

Introduce the THIS_VOID and THIS() macros to make dealing with void pointers a little safer.\n\nSince we don't want to expose void pointers in header files, driver functions have been removed from the headers and the various driver objects return their interface type.  This cuts down on accessor methods and the vast majority of those functions were not being used.  Move functions that are still required to .intern.h.\n\nRemove the special \"C\" crypto functions that were used in libc and instead use the standard interface."

In a busy environment this could mean tens or hundreds of thousands of files.\n\nAnother issue was that the error files could not be written until a list of WAL files to process had been generated.  This was easy enough for archive-get but archive-push requires more processing and any errors that happened when generating the list would only be reported in the pgBackRest log rather than the PostgreSQL log.\n\nInstead write a global.error file that applies to any WAL file that does not have an explicit ok or error file.

If this behavior is not desirable then tlsClientClose() may be used to ensure that the next call to tlsClientOpen() will create a new TLS session.\n\nNote that tlsClientRead() is non-blocking unless there are *zero* bytes to be read from the session in which case it will raise an error after the defined timeout. In any case the tlsClientRead()/tlsClientWrite()/tlsClientEof() functions should not generally be called directly.

Both operations require the WAL segment size to properly build a list.\n\nChecking the archive after a backup is still implemented in Perl and has an active database connection, so just get the WAL segment size from the database.\n\nThe archive-get command does not have a connection to the database, so get the WAL segment size from pg_control instead.  This requires a deeper inspection of pg_control than has been done in the past, so it seemed best to copy the relevant data structures from each version of PostgreSQL and build a generic interface layer to address them.  While this approach is a bit verbose, it has the advantage of being relatively simple, and can easily be updated for new versions of PostgreSQL.\n\nSince the integration tests generate pg_control files for testing, teach Perl how to generate files with the correct offsets for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures."

Not only was the local command used for the naming of log files but the process id was not pass through.  This meant every remote log was named \"[stanza]-local-remote-000\" which is confusing and meant multiple processes were writing to the same log.\n\nInstead, pass the real command and process id to the remote.  This required a minor change in locking to ignore locks if process id is greater than 0 since remotes started by locals never lock."

This allows them to handle secrets because they will not pass values to subprocesses as parameters.  Instead, each subprocess is expected to check the environment directly during configuration parsing.\n\nIn passing, move the error about secrets being passed on the command-line up to command-line parsing and make the error more generic with respect to the configuration file now that multiple configuration files are allowed."

They verified the contents of a table in the (supposedly) restored tablespace, deleted the table, and then deleted the tablespace.  All of this was deemed sufficient to prove that the tablespace had been restored correctly and was valid.\n\nHowever, PostgreSQL will happily recreate a tablespace on the basis of a single full-page write, at least in the affected versions.  Since writes to the test table were replayed from WAL with each recovery, all the tests passed even though the tablespace was missing after the restore.\n\nThe tests have been updated to include direct comparisons against the file system and a new table that is not replayed after a restore because it is created before the backup and never modified again.\n\nVersions ≥ 9.0 were not affected due to numerous synthetic integration tests that verify backups and restores file by file."

The new spool-path option can be used to define a location for queueing WAL segments when archiving asynchronously. Otherwise, a local repository is no longer required.\n\n* Implemented a new config format which should be far simpler to use. See the User Guide and Configuration Reference for details but for a simple configuration all options can now be placed in the stanza section. Options that are shared between stanzas can be placed in the [global] section. More complex configurations can still make use of command sections though this should be a rare use case.\n\n* The default configuration filename is now pgbackrest.conf instead of pg_backrest.conf. This was done for consistency with other naming changes but also to prevent old config files from being loaded accidentally.\n\n* The default repository name was changed from /var/lib/backup to /var/lib/pgbackrest.\n\n* Lock files are now stored in /tmp/pgbackrest by default. These days /run/pgbackrest would be the preferred location but that would require init scripts which are not part of this release. The lock-path option can be used to configure the lock directory.\n\n* Log files are now stored in /var/log/pgbackrest by default and no longer have the date appended so they can be managed with logrotate. The log-path option can be used to configure the lock directory.\n\n* Executable filename changed from pg_backrest to pgbackrest."
