        <title>Introduction</title>

        <p><backrest/> aims to be a simple, reliable backup and restore system that can seamlessly scale up to the largest databases and workloads.

        Primary <backrest/> features:
        <ul>
            <li>Local or remote backup</li>
            <li>Multi-threaded backup/restore for performance</li>
            <li>Checksums</li>
            <li>Safe backups (checks that logs required for consistency are present before backup completes)</li>
            <li>Full, differential, and incremental backups</li>
            <li>Backup rotation (and minimum retention rules with optional separate retention for archive)</li>
            <li>In-stream compression/decompression</li>
            <li>Archiving and retrieval of logs for replicas/restores built in</li>
            <li>Async archiving for very busy systems (including space limits)</li>
            <li>Backup directories are consistent <postgres/> clusters (when hardlinks are on and compression is off)</li>
            <li>Tablespace support</li>
            <li>Restore delta option</li>
            <li>Restore using timestamp/size or checksum</li>
            <li>Restore remapping base/tablespaces</li>
            <li>Support for <postgres/> >= 8.3</li></ul>
            Instead of relying on traditional backup tools like tar and rsync, <backrest/> implements all backup features internally and uses a custom protocol for communicating with remote systems.  Removing reliance on tar and rsync allows for better solutions to database-specific backup issues.  The custom remote protocol limits the types of connections that are required to perform a backup which increases security.</p>

    <section id="recognition">
        <title>Recognition</title>

        <p>Primary recognition goes to Stephen Frost for all his valuable advice and criticism during the development of <backrest/>.

        <link url="{[crunchy-url-base]}">Crunchy Data</link> has contributed significant time and resources to <backrest/> and continues to actively support development. <link url="{[resonate-url-base]}">Resonate</link> also contributed to the development of <backrest/> and allowed early (but well tested) versions to be installed as their primary <postgres/> backup solution.</p>
