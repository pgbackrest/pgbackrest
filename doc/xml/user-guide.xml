    <!-- SECTION => INTRODUCTION -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <title>Introduction</title>

        <p>This user guide is intended to be followed sequentially from beginning to end &amp;mdash; each section depends on the last.  For example the <link section="/backup">Backup</link> section relies on setup that is performed in the <link section="/quickstart">Quick Start</link> section.  Once you have <backrest/> up and running then skipping around is possible but it is recommended to follow the user guide in order the first time through.</p>

        <p>Although the examples are targeted at Ubuntu and <postgres/> 9.4 they will also work fine on Debian and it should be fairly easy to apply this guide to any Unix distribution and <postgres/> version.  The only OS-specific commands are those to create, start, stop, and drop <postgres/> clusters.  The <backrest/> commands will be the same on any Unix system though the locations to install Perl libraries and executables may vary.  Configuring archiving is different on <postgres/> versions &amp;lt;= 8.4 and configuration information can be found in the <postgres/> documentation.</p>

        <p>A somewhat novel approach is taken to documentation in this user guide.  Each command is run on a virtual machine when the documentation is built from the XML source.  This means you can have a high confidence that the commands work correctly in the order presented.  Output is captured and displayed below the command when appropriate.  If the output is not included it is because it was deemed not relevant or was considered a distraction from the narrative.</p>

        <p>All commands are intended to be run as an unprivileged user that has sudo privileges for both the <user>root</user> and <user>postgres</user> users.  It's also possible to run the commands directly as their respective users without modification and in that case the <cmd>sudo</cmd> commands can be stripped off.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION => CONCEPTS -->
    <section id="concept">
        <title>Concepts</title>

        <p>The following concepts are defined as they are relevant to <backrest/>, <postgres/>, and this user guide.</p>

        <!-- SECTION => CONCEPTS - BACKUP -->
        <section id="backup">
            <title>Backup</title>

            <p>A backup is a consistent copy of a database cluster that can be restored to recover from a hardware failure, to perform Point-In-Time Recovery, or to bring up a new standby.</p>

            <p><b>Full Backup</b>: <backrest/> copies the entire contents of the database cluster to the backup server. The first backup of the database cluster is always a Full Backup. <backrest/> is always able to restore a full backup directly. The full backup does not depend on any files outside of the full backup for consistency.</p>

            <p><b>Differential Backup</b>: <backrest/> copies only those database cluster files that have changed since the last full backup. <backrest/> restores a differential backup by copying all of the files in the chosen differential backup and the appropriate unchanged files from the previous full backup. The advantage of a differential backup is that it requires less disk space than a full backup, however, the differential backup and the full backup must both be valid to restore the differential backup.</p>

            <p><b>Incremental Backup</b>: <backrest/> copies only those database cluster files that have changed since the last backup (which can be another incremental backup, a differential backup, or a full backup). As an incremental backup only includes those files changed since the prior backup, they are generally much smaller than full or differential backups. As with the differential backup, the incremental backup depends on other backups to be valid to restore the incremental backup. Since the incremental backup includes only those files since the last backup, all prior incremental backups back to the prior differential, the prior differential backup, and the prior full backup must all be valid to perform a restore of the incremental backup. If no differential backup exists then all prior incremental backups back to the prior full backup, which must exist, and the full backup itself must be valid to restore the incremental backup.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION => CONCEPTS - RESTORE -->
        <section id="restore">
            <title>Restore</title>

            <p>A restore is the act of copying a backup to a system where it will be started as a live database cluster.  A restore requires the backup files and one or more WAL segments in order to work correctly.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION => CONCEPTS - WAL -->
        <section id="wal">
            <title>Write Ahead Log (WAL)</title>

            <p>WAL is the mechanism that <postgres/> uses to ensure that no committed changes are lost. Transactions are written sequentially to the WAL and a transaction is considered to be committed when those writes are flushed to disk. Afterwards, a background process writes the changes into the main database cluster files (also known as the heap). In the event of a crash, the WAL is replayed to make the database consistent.</p>

            <p>WAL is conceptually infinite but in practice is broken up into individual 16MB files called segments.  WAL segments follow the naming convention <id>0000000100000A1E000000FE</id> where the first 8 hexadecimal digits represent the timeline and the next 16 digits are the logical sequence number (LSN).</p>

            <p>A valid backup will always include <i>at least</i> one WAL segment even if explicit writes were made to the database between backups.</p>

            <p>Creating the demo cluster is optional but commands in the user guide may not work in other environments without significant modification.  The cluster won't be started immediately because there is still some configuration to do.</p>

            <p>By default <postgres/> will only accept local connections.  The examples in this guide will require connections from other servers so <pg-option>listen_addresses</pg-option> is configured to listen on all interfaces.  This may not be appropriate for secure installations.</p>

            <p>Demo describes the purpose of this cluster accurately so that will also make a good stanza name.</p>

            <p><backrest/> needs to know where the base data directory for the <postgres/> cluster is located.  The path can be requested from <postgres/> directly but in a recovery scenario the <postgres/> process will not be available.  During backups the value supplied to <backrest/> will be compared against the path that <postgres/> is running on and they must be equal or the backup will return an error.  Make sure that <br-option>db-path</br-option> is exactly equal to <pg-option>data_directory</pg-option> in <file>postgresql.conf</file>.</p>

            <p>By default Ubuntu stores clusters in <path>/var/lib/postgresql/[version]/[cluster]</path> so it is easy to determine the correct path for the data directory.</p>

            <p><link section="/quickstart/perform-restore">Restore a Backup</link> in <link section="/quickstart">Quick Start</link> required the database cluster directory to be cleaned before the <cmd>restore</cmd> could be performed.  The <br-option>delta</br-option> option allows <backrest/> to automatically determine which files in the database cluster directory can be preserved and which ones need to be restored from the backup &amp;mdash; it also <i>removes</i> files not present in the backup manifest so it will dispose of divergent changes.  This is accomplished by calculating a <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA-1</link> cryptographic hash for each file in the database cluster directory.  If the <id>SHA-1</id> hash does not match the hash stored in the backup then that file will be restored.  This operation is very efficient when combined with the <br-option>thread-max</br-option> option.  Since the <postgres/> process is shut down during the restore, a larger number of threads can be used than might be desirable during a backup when the <postgres/> process is running.</p>

        <p><link section="/quickstart/perform-restore">Restore a Backup</link> in <link section="/quickstart">Quick Start</link> performed default recovery, which is to play all the way to the end of the WAL stream.  In the case of a hardware failure this is usually the best choice but for data corruption scenarios (whether machine or human in origin) Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) is often more appropriate.</p>

        <p>Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) allows the WAL to be played from the last backup to a specified time, transaction id, or recovery point.  For common recovery scenarios time-based recovery is arguably the most useful.  A typical recovery scenario is to restore a table that was accidentally dropped or data that was accidentally deleted.  Recovering a dropped table is more dramatic so that's the example given here but deleted data would be recovered in exactly the same way.</p>
