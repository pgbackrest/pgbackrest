                <p>Fixed an issue where the master process was passing <setting>{[dash]}-repo-remote-path</setting> instead of <setting>{[dash]}-repo-path</setting> to the remote and causing the lock files to be created in the default repository directory (<path>/var/lib/backup</path>), generally ending in failure. This was only an issue when <setting>{[dash]}-repo-remote-path</setting> was defined on the command line rather than in <file>pg_backrest.conf</file>.</p>
