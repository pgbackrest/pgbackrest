                <p>The <cmd>archive-get</cmd> command now returns a 1 when the archive file is missing to differentiate from hard errors (ssh connection failure, file copy error, etc.) This lets <postgres/> know that the archive stream has terminated normally. However, this does not take into account possible holes in the archive stream.</p>
