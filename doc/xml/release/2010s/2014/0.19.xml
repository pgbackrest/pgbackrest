                <p>Found and squashed a nasty bug where <code>file_copy()</code> was defaulted to ignore errors. There was also an issue in <code>file_exists()</code> that was causing the test to fail when the file actually did exist. Together they could have resulted in a corrupt backup with no errors, though it is very unlikely.</p>

                <p>Worked on improving error handling in the <code>File</code> object. This is not complete, but works well enough to find a few errors that have been causing us problems (notably, find is occasionally failing building the archive async manifest when system is under load).</p>
