                <p>Symlinks are no longer created in backup directories in the repository. These symlinks could point virtually anywhere and potentially be dangerous. Symlinks are still recreated during a restore.</p>

                <p>Added better messaging for backup expiration. Full and differential backup expirations are logged on a single line along with a list of all dependent backups expired.</p>
