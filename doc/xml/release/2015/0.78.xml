                <p>Removed dependency on CPAN packages for multi-threaded operation. While it might not be a bad idea to update the <code>threads</code> and <code>Thread::Queue</code> packages, it is no longer necessary.</p>

            <release-item>
                <p>Modified wait backoff to use a Fibonacci rather than geometric sequence. This will make wait time grow less aggressively while still giving reasonable values.</p>
