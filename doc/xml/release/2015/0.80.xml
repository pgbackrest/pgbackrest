                <p>Fixed an issue that caused the formatted timestamp for both the oldest and newest backups to be reported as the current time by the <cmd>info</cmd> command. Only <id>text</id> output was affected {[dash]}- <id>json</id> output reported the correct epoch values.</p>
            </release-item>

            <release-item>
                <p>Fixed protocol issue that was preventing ssh errors (especially on connection) from being logged.</p>

                </release-item-contributor-list>

                <p>The repository is now created and updated with consistent directory and file modes. By default <id>umask</id> is set to <id>0000</id> but this can be disabled with the <setting>neutral-umask</setting> setting.</p>
            </release-item>

            <release-item>
                <p>Added the <br-option>stop-auto</br-option> option to allow failed backups to automatically be stopped when a new backup starts.</p>
            </release-item>

            <release-item>
                <p>Added the <br-option>db-timeout</br-option> option to limit the amount of time <backrest/> will wait for <code>pg_start_backup()</code> and <code>pg_stop_backup()</code> to return.</p>
            </release-item>

            <release-item>
                <p>Remove <file>pg_control</file> file at the beginning of the restore and copy it back at the very end. This prevents the possibility that a partial restore can be started by <postgres/>.</p>
            </release-item>

            <release-item>
                <p>Added checks to be sure the <setting>db-path</setting> setting is consistent with <setting>db-port</setting> by comparing the <setting>data_directory</setting> as reported by the cluster against the <setting>db-path</setting> setting and the version as reported by the cluster against the value read from <file>pg_control</file>. The <setting>db-socket-path</setting> setting is checked to be sure it is an absolute path.</p>
            </release-item>

            <release-item>
                <p>Experimental support for <postgres/> 9.5 alpha1. This may break when the control version or WAL magic changes in future versions but will be updated in each <backrest/> release to keep pace. All regression tests pass except for <setting>{[dash]}-target-resume</setting> tests (this functionality has changed in 9.5) and there is no testing yet for <file>.partial</file> WAL segments.</p>
            </release-item>
        </release-feature-list>

        <release-improvement-list>
            <release-item>
                <p>Now using Perl <code>DBI</code> and <code>DBD::Pg</code> for connections to <postgres/> rather than <cmd>psql</cmd>. The <setting>cmd-psql</setting> and <setting>cmd-psql-option</setting> settings have been removed and replaced with <setting>db-port</setting> and <setting>db-socket-path</setting>. Follow the instructions in the Installation Guide to install <code>DBD::Pg</code> on your operating system.</p>

        <release-development-list>
            <release-item>
                <p>Major refactoring of the protocol layer to support future development.</p>

    <release-doc-list>
        <release-development-list>
            <release-item>
                <p>Split most of <file>README.md</file> out into <file>USERGUIDE.md</file> and <file>CHANGELOG.md</file> because it was becoming unwieldy. Changed most references to <quote>database</quote> in the user guide to <quote>database cluster</quote> for clarity.</p>
