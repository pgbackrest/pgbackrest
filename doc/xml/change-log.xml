                <release-feature>
                    <text>Fixed an issue where longer-running backups/restores would timeout when remote and threaded.  Keepalives are now used to make sure the remote for the main process does not timeout while the thread remotes do all the work.  The error messages for timeouts was also improved to make debugging easier.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Added better messaging for backup expiration.  Full and differential backup expirations are logged on a single line along with a list of all dependent backups expired.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Added a new user guide that covers <backrest/> basics and some advanced topics including PITR.  Much more to come, but it's a start.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Added new feature to allow all <backrest/> operations to be stopped or started using the <cmd>stop</cmd> and <cmd>start</cmd> commands.  This prevents any <backrest/> processes from running on a system where <postgres/> is shutdown or the system needs to be quiesced for some reason.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Fixed an issue where a resume would fail if temp files were left in the root backup directory when the backup failed.  This scenario was likely if the backup process got terminated during the copy phase.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Experimental support for <postgres/> 9.5 beta1.  This may break when the control version or WAL magic changes in future versions but will be updated in each <backrest/> release to keep pace.  All regression tests pass except for <setting>--target-resume</setting> tests (this functionality has changed in 9.5) and there is no testing yet for <file>.partial</file> WAL segments.</text>

                    <text>Fixed an issue that caused the formatted timestamp for both the oldest and newest backups to be reported as the current time by the <cmd>info</cmd> command.  Only <id>text</id> output was affected -- <id>json</id> output reported the correct epoch values.  <i>Reported by Michael Renner</i>.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Now using Perl <code>DBI</code> and <code>DBD::Pg</code> for connections to <postgres/> rather than <cmd>psql</cmd>.  The <setting>cmd-psql</setting> and <setting>cmd-psql-option</setting> settings have been removed and replaced with <setting>db-port</setting> and <setting>db-socket-path</setting>.

                    <text>Remove <file>pg_control</file> file at the beginning of the restore and copy it back at the very end.  This prevents the possibility that a partial restore can be started by <postgres/>.</text>

                    <text>Added checks to be sure the <setting>db-path</setting> setting is consistent with <setting>db-port</setting> by comparing the <setting>data_directory</setting> as reported by the cluster against the <setting>db-path</setting> setting and the version as reported by the cluster against the value read from <file>pg_control</file>.  The <setting>db-socket-path</setting> setting is checked to be sure it is an absolute path.</text>

                    <text>Removed dependency on CPAN packages for multi-threaded operation.  While it might not be a bad idea to update the <code>threads</code> and <code>Thread::Queue</code> packages, it is no longer necessary.</text>

                    <text><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: This flag day release breaks compatibility with older versions of <backrest/>.  The manifest format, on-disk structure, and the binary names have all changed.  You must create a new repository to hold backups for this version of <backrest/> and keep your older repository for a time in case you need to do a restore.  The <file>pg_backrest.conf</file> file has not changed but you'll need to change any references to <file>pg_backrest.pl</file> in cron (or elsewhere) to <file>pg_backrest</file> (without the <file>.pl</file> extension).</text>

                    <text>More efficient file ordering for <cmd>backup</cmd>.  Files are copied in descending size order so a single thread does not end up copying a large file at the end.  This had already been implemented for <cmd>restore</cmd>.</text>

                    <text>Fixed an issue in async archiving where <cmd>archive-push</cmd> was not properly returning 0 when <setting>archive-max-mb</setting> was reached and moved the async check after transfer to avoid having to remove the stop file twice.  Also added unit tests for this case and improved error messages to make it clearer to the user what went wrong.  <i>Reported by Michael Renner</i>.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Fixed a locking issue that could allow multiple operations of the same type against a single stanza.  This appeared to be benign in terms of data integrity but caused spurious errors while archiving and could lead to errors in backup/restore. <i>Reported by Michael Renner</i>.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Better resume support.  Resumed files are checked to be sure they have not been modified and the manifest is saved more often to preserve checksums as the backup progresses.  More unit tests to verify each resume case.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Added <setting>tablespace</setting> setting to allow tablespaces to be restored into the <path>pg_tblspc</path> path.  This produces compact restores that are convenient for development, staging, etc.  Currently these restores cannot be backed up as <backrest/> expects only links in the <path>pg_tblspc</path> path.</text>

                    <text>Fixed a buffering error that could occur on large, highly-compressible files when copying to an uncompressed remote destination.  The error was detected in the decompression code and resulted in a failed backup rather than corruption so it should not affect successful backups made with previous versions.</text>

                    <text>Added option <param>--no-start-stop</param> to allow backups when Postgres is shut down.  If <file>postmaster.pid</file> is present then <param>--force</param> is required to make the backup run (though if Postgres is running an inconsistent backup will likely be created).

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Working on improving error handling in the <code>File</code> object.  This is not complete, but works well enough to find a few errors that have been causing us problems (notably, find is occasionally failing building the archive async manifest when system is under load).</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Found and squashed a nasty bug where <code>file_copy()</code> was defaulted to ignore errors.  There was also an issue in <code>file_exists()</code> that was causing the test to fail when the file actually did exist.  Together they could have resulted in a corrupt backup with no errors, though it is very unlikely.</text>

                    <text>The <cmd>archive-get</cmd> command returns a 1 when the archive file is missing to differentiate from hard errors (ssh connection failure, file copy error, etc.)  This lets <postgres/> know that that the archive stream has terminated normally.

                    <text>If an archive directory which should be empty could not be deleted backrest was throwing an error.  There's a good fix for that coming, but for the time being it has been changed to a warning so processing can continue.  This was impacting backups as sometimes the final archive file would not get pushed if the first archive file had been in a different directory (plus some bad luck).</text>

                    <text>No restore functionality, but the backup directories are consistent <postgres/> data directories.  You'll need to either uncompress the files or turn off compression in the backup.  Uncompressed backups on a ZFS (or similar) filesystem are a good option because backups can be restored locally via a snapshot to create logical backups or do spot data recovery.</text>

                    <text>Archiving is single-threaded.  This has not posed an issue on our multi-terabyte databases with heavy write volume.  Recommend a large WAL volume or to use the async option with a large volume nearby.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Backups are multi-threaded, but the <code>Net::OpenSSH</code> library does not appear to be 100% thread-safe so it will very occasionally lock up on a thread.  There is an overall process timeout that resolves this issue by killing the process.  Yes, very ugly.</text>
