            <install-system title="Regression Test Setup">
                <text>* Create the backrest user

                The backrest user must be created on the same system and in the same group as the user you will use for testing (which can be any user you prefer).  For example:
                <code-block>
                    adduser -g &lt;test-user-group&gt; backrest
                </code-block>
                * Setup password-less SSH login between the test user and the backrest user

                The test user should be able to `ssh backrest@127.0.0.1` and the backrest user should be able to `ssh &lt;testuser&gt;@127.0.0.1` without requiring any passwords.  This article (http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/h/66) has details on how to accomplish this.  Do the logons both ways at the command line before running regression tests.

                * Give group read and execute permissions to <path>~/backrest/test</path>:

                Usually this can be accomplished by running the following as the test user:
                <code-block>
                    chmod 750 ~
                </code-block>
                * Running regression:

                Running the full regression suite is generally not necessary.  Run the following first:
                <code-block>
                    ./test.pl {[dash]}-module=backup {[dash]}-test=full {[dash]}-db-version=all {[dash]}-thread-max=&lt;# threads&gt;
                </code-block>
                This will run full backup/restore regression with a variety of options on all installed versions of <postgres/>.  If you are only interested in one version then modify the <setting>db-version</setting> setting to X.X (e.g. 9.4).  <setting>{[dash]}-thread-max</setting> can be omitted if you are running single-threaded.

                If there are errors in this test then run full regression to help isolate problems:
                <code-block>
                    ./test.pl {[dash]}-db-version=all {[dash]}-thread-max=&lt;# threads&gt;
                </code-block>

    <config title="Configuration Reference">
        <text><backrest/> can be used entirely with command-line parameters but a configuration file is more practical for installations that are complex or set a lot of options. The default location for the configuration file is <file>/etc/pg_backrest.conf</file>.</text>

                        <text>The repository serves as both storage and working area for <backrest/>.  In a simple installation where the backups are stored locally on the database server there will be only one repository which will contain everything: backups, archives, logs, locks, etc.

                        If the backups are being done remotely then the backup server's repository will contain backups, archives, locks and logs while the database server's repository will contain only locks and logs.  However, if asynchronous archiving is enabled then the database server's repository will also contain a spool directory for archive logs that have not yet been pushed to the remote repository.

                        Each system where <backrest/> is installed should have a repository directory configured.  Storage requirements vary based on usage.  The main backup repository will need the most space as it contains both backups and WAL segments for whatever retention you have specified.  The database repository only needs significant space if asynchronous archiving is enabled and then it will act as an overflow for WAL segments and might need to be large depending on your database activity.

                        If you are new to backup then it will be difficult to estimate in advance how much space you'll need.  The best thing to do is take some backups then record the size of different types of backups (full/incr/diff) and measure the amount of WAL generated per day.  This will give you a general idea of how much space you'll need, though of course requirements will change over time as your database evolves.

                    <text>A stanza is the configuration for a <postgres/> database cluster that defines where it is located, how it will be backed up, archiving options, etc.  Most db servers will only have one Postgres database cluster and therefore one stanza, whereas backup servers will have a stanza for every database cluster that needs to be backed up.

                    It is tempting to name the stanza after the primary cluster but a better name describes the databases contained in the cluster.  Because the stanza name will be used for the primary and all replicas it is more appropriate to choose a name that describes the actual function of the cluster, such as app or dw, rather than the local cluster name, such as main or prod.</text>

                        There are some scenarios where a backup might still be desirable under these conditions.  For example, if a server crashes and the database cluster volume can only be mounted read-only, it would be a good idea to take a backup even if <file>postmaster.pid</file> is present.  In this case it would be better to revert to the prior backup and replay WAL, but possibly there is a very important transaction in a WAL segment that did not get archived.</text>

Be careful about specifying your own <setting>restore_command</setting> as <backrest/> is designed to handle this for you.  Target Recovery options (recovery_target_name, recovery_target_time, etc.) are generated automatically by <backrest/> and should not be set with this option.

                        Recovery settings can also be set in the <setting>restore:recovery-option</setting> section of pg_backrest.conf.  For example:

                        Since <backrest/> does not start <postgres/> after writing the <file>recovery.conf</file> file, it is always possible to edit/check <file>recovery.conf</file> before manually restarting.</text>
